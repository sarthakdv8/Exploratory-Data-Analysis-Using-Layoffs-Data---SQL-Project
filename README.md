# 📉 Exploratory Data Analysis Using Layoffs Data – SQL Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
The global job market has seen significant fluctuations, with mass layoffs impacting various industries. This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover trends in layoffs across companies, industries, and countries.

🔹 Tech Stack: SQL (MySQL)
🔹 Dataset: Layoffs data sourced from public records
🔹 Scope: Identifying layoff patterns, trends, and economic impacts

## 🔍 Key Findings
#### ✅ Layoff Trends Over Time:

Major spikes in layoffs observed during economic downturns (e.g., pandemic years 2022).
#### ✅ Industries with the Highest Layoffs:

Consumer, Retail, and Finance sectors experienced the most significant workforce reductions.

Some of the biggest layoffs were from Fortune 500 companies and startups with high funding like Amazon, Google, Meta.
Google during 2023 has the biggest contribution in layoffs.
#### ✅ Stage Layoff Trends:

The Post-IPO, Acquired, and C-Series Funding stage companies reported the highest number of layoffs.
#### ✅ Funding vs. Layoffs:

Some startups that raised billions in funding still conducted mass layoffs due to economic pressures.
Some of the Comapnies are Google,Amazon
